### Assumptions
(1). Only variables that are passed to or from the supervisory control via BACnet/IP network can be attacked.

(2). Cooling towers use local ambient temperature measurements for cooling tower fan speed control

(3). Airside economizer use local air temperature measurements such as mixed air temperature, outdoor air temperature etc., for economizing control.
