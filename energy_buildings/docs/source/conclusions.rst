===========

This paper presents a modeling and simulation framework for evaluating the impact of threats on the building energy and control system. 
Four different threats and their active combinations are numerically investigated to demonstrate the capability and flexibility of the framework. 
From the simulation results, we see that different threats can compromise the system to different degrees, among which the remote control of chiller has the most significant consequences on the system operation, while the other studied attacks have insignificant or mild impact. It is also noted that the attack influences the system not only during the threat period but also the post-threat period.

It is critical for GEB operators to further understand the most adversarial attack so that they can spend their limited resources on the design of defending schemes. 
This framework can help identify the most adversarial attacks by establishing and simulating a comprehensive list of threat scenarios. 
Future work will also include designing an impact scoring algorithm to standardize the severity of different attacks.
